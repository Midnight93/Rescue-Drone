### The project deals with finding a person in need by using a drone, the drone will patrol the surface by a command of a human operation found in a control room using the software we wrote.

### This program combines many commands for the operation of the system:
- creating the drone track, which is determined by the mission planer program.
- continued operation after finding the person.
- keeping the drone data.
- sending the location of the person founded to the server and through it to the application for use of a search team.
- creating a detailed report of the event at the end.

Human identification is done by image processing, by the SSD algorithm which we researched and studied during the project.
today there is no such system and therefore we found it necessary to develop and study and build our system.
The goal of the project is to minimize the disadvantages that exist today in a search for human lost or in distress.

this disadvantages includes: many expenses, use of a large number of teams to search, a waste of critical time and more.
Our system is essentially a semi-automatic system, which enables you to operate a whole fleet of drones with minimal manpower, minimize the initial response time to find a person in distress, and save on the expenses of all the resources mentioned above.

Our system identifies a person, alerts, and the operator decides how to proceed with the information received.
